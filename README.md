# LaborasLang
Procedural language with select functional features


##Introduction

```
entry auto greeter = void()
{
	System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
};
```
This hello world program, without having any groundbreaking changes, shows some key features of this language:
* function declaration looks just like variable declaration and assignment
* variable type will be determined by compiler if you ask us to do that by using "auto" instead of type
* we are selecting application entry point by marking it as "entry" instead of forcing you to use some special name for function


##Basic syntax

###Procedures
###Conditional statements
###Structures
###Loops
